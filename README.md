##Simple task scheduling app in python. 

The user can use the console to login, add new users, add and delete tasks and write the data in a readable format to a txt file. 
The files will be saved to the parent directory. The programme uses a pseudo form of authentification, authorisation and data storage. The programme does not use a secure
authorisation or authentification method and the data is stored locally and does not use a database. The code serves as an example, not for real life implementation.
